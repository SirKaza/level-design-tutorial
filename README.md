# Level Design Tutorial

This repository contains a Unity project showcasing a tutorial level for a game inspired by the legend of Cú Chulainn. The level introduces players to the core mechanics while also establishing the story and setting the tone for the adventure.

## Level Overview

The tutorial level serves as both a gameplay introduction and a narrative setup. Players are guided through mechanics while experiencing the story’s opening cinematic and early challenges.

### Cinematic Introduction

The level begins with a cinematic that introduces the player to Cú Chulainn and the circumstances leading to this moment. Key story elements include:

- The importance of the Brown Bull of Cooley
- The looming conflict
- Cú Chulainn’s role as a guardian

Cinematic sequence:  
"Cú Chulainn is inside the ruins, guarding the bull as a soldier. While he stands watch, the ruins begin to collapse. The scene fades to black, signifying that he has lost consciousness."

After the cinematic, the player is placed in the first area of the level.

### Level Structure

The tutorial is divided into three main areas, designed to teach gameplay mechanics progressively:

1. **Bull Altar**  
   - Starting point after the cinematic.  
   - Player learns basic movement around the altar.  
   - Health is reduced due to the collapsed ruins, introducing a risk element early on.

2. **Debris Zone**  
   - Player encounters a hole trap, teaching the dash mechanic.  
   - A healing area with mushrooms is provided to recover health.  
   - The path forward is blocked by debris, prompting the player to learn melee attacks by finding a weapon.

3. **Into the House**  
   - Narrow paths with elevating platforms require coordination and mastery of dash.  
   - Inside the house, the player faces the first enemy, combining all learned mechanics to defeat them.  
   - Completion allows progression to the next level area.

## Features

- Designed in Unity  
- Focused on teaching movement, dash, melee combat, and basic survival mechanics  
- Narrative-driven tutorial level  
- Interactive environmental obstacles  

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:  
2. Open the project in Unity
